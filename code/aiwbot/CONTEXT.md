# aiwbot
> Provider-agnostic bot: control swappable coding agents (claude·opencode·copilot) from chat.
> goal: [workspace-os](../../brain/goals/workspace-os.md)
> spec: none

## Overview
One `AgentBackend` interface normalizes every coding-agent CLI into a stream of `AgentEvent`s,
so the frontend (Telegram) never knows which provider runs underneath — provider is data, not code.
Phase A (current) proves the boundary against claude + opencode with a bare harness + free fixture tests,
before any Telegram wiring.

`make test` runs the free fixture tests; `make smoke` runs one live prompt through each backend
(~$0.20). Installing and operating the systemd service is
[`SETUP-telegram.md`](../../SETUP-telegram.md); the token and the chat pairing are an account, and
live with every other one.

This tree is the `bot` feature of the workspace registry, and the only project under `code/` that
crosses into the public repo — the switch is read at `main()` and again at the INBOX write.

| Subdirectory | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [`backend/`](backend/CONTEXT.md) | Provider-agnostic boundary: each coding-agent CLI → normalized AgentEvent stream; one class per provider. |
| [`frontend/`](frontend/CONTEXT.md) | Telegram frontend on the AgentBackend boundary — /new + reply-to-continue + INBOX capture. |
| [`tests/`](tests/CONTEXT.md) | Free unit tests — pure-logic fixtures/parsers/formatting, no network or cost. |
