# registry in core/ (features.txt, profile.txt, deps.txt, harnesses.txt are the same shape). What
# gets published is generated from it and owned by nobody: a `_redirects` file in a throwaway
# public repo. Delete that repo and one `build` rebuilds it; delete this file and the short names are
# gone, which is the asymmetry that decides where it lives.

# A short name is what Lucas says out loud to a room, so the grammar is what survives being spoken and

# WHY THESE ARE REFUSED, AND WHY THE CHECK IS ON THE SHORT NAME RATHER THAN THE URL.
# A redirect is public: anyone who types a short name is sent wherever it points. That is harmless when
# the target needs a Google login — they hit a permission wall. It is NOT harmless for a document
# shared as "anyone with the link", because a guessable short name turns *unlisted* into *discoverable*,
# and the branches/ notary, health and finance documents are exactly the kind shared that way.
# The URL cannot answer this — a Drive URL looks identical whoever it is shared with — so the
# guard keys on the two things that CAN answer: the name Lucas chose, and the file he is
# recording the link in. Both are refusals, not warnings, because the failure is silent and
# permanent: nothing ever tells you a stranger guessed the short name.
