# warn-exempt: a suite file grows by CASE, and every case here is a defect that shipped. Cutting to
# the warn deletes coverage, which is the one thing a line count may never buy. The block cap still
# applies: past it this file is split by question, the way it was split from the corpus ratchet.
# and said so: "they live here rather than in a file of their own ... they assert something about
# the WHOLE TREE". That reason was right about the DIRECTORY and wrong about the file. Being
# whole-tree is what puts both halves in workspace/; it is not what makes them one question. The
# corpus half asks whether the .md backlog is shrinking, this half asks whether the port is
# holding, and a file that answers two questions hits the line cap with neither of them finished.
#
# Every ceiling only ever goes down, and a ceiling of zero IS an assert. One ceiling per defect,
# never one shared: a shared number lets one defect grow while another shrinks and reports calm.
#
# I5 -- one branch, one codebase -- is deliberately absent. It is not a property of any file, and a
# test pretending to check it would be the weaker kind this workspace names.
#
# The encoding law is no longer owed: it is held next door by test_encoding_ratchet.py, which is
# also where it is now WRITTEN, because the "AD-9" this file used to cite named no section that
# existed. It was owed here with the guess "the corpus is clean". It was not -- the ast walk found
# 304 inheriting call sites in 113 files the first time one was pointed at the tree, and two of them
# were failing this suite on a Windows clone while reading as an unrelated TypeError.
