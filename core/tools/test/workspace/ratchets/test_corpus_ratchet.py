# T0 corpus ratchets (core/SCHEMA.md § Placement): the .md corpus may not accumulate more of the three
# defects no link-checker can see. Zero-token, runs in verify-fast.
#
# These sit here rather than beside the checks they call because they assert something
# about the WHOLE TREE, not about one piece of machinery: test_entropy_list.py and
# test_entropy_context.py own whether each check fires correctly, this owns whether the
# backlog is shrinking. Same split as test_pointer_integrity.py beside it.
#
# The OS-port invariants were here too until 2026-08-29 and are now test_port_ratchet.py. Being
# whole-tree is what puts both in this directory; it is not what makes them one file. The shared
# `_git` moved to conftest.py as git_lines() rather than being copied.
#
# Every ceiling only ever goes down. Each is paired with a staleness test, because a ratchet
# nobody lowers is just a baseline, and a baseline is where drift hides.
#
# A ceiling per defect, never one shared ceiling: until 2026-08-15 the placeholder marker was
# counted as finished-work prose, and 70 markers could have masked 70 new corpses without the
# number moving. One ratchet per thing the report names.

# The marker queue fell 69 → 55 on 2026-08-15 without a single file being described by hand:
# the generator learned to read a multi-line module docstring and the `core/hooks` data files
# (core/hooks/SPECS.md § The `CONTEXT.md` routing block). Markers answered by closing a
# generator gap are the cheapest kind, and they are indistinguishable here from ones answered
# by writing prose — which is the point.
