# T0 the install is a procedure, not prose (core/SCHEMA.md § The .md type system): every SETUP.md
# step declares its feature and carries a precondition, an install and a verify check.
#
# The harness is the installer — a newcomer's own agent reads SETUP.md and executes it. That only
# works if every step says how to tell it is already done and how to prove it worked. This file is
# what stops the next added step from being a paragraph.
