# b20260901-the-facade-set-is-written-out-in-four-places regression — what a file IS has one home.
#
# `{'index.ts','index.tsx','index.js','index.jsx','__init__.py','index.dart'}` was spelled out
# identically in stubgen/stubs.py (FACADES), facade/facade-gate.py, facade/facade-tracker.py and
# routing/workspace_scanner.py (under a second name, in the last three). Found 2026-09-01 adding a
# gate that would have been the fifth. core/hooks/CONTEXT.md says the law lives in that directory's
# root and a checker restating any of it is the drift the checkers exist to catch — this was that
# drift four times over, inside the enforcement layer, and the four had ALREADY diverged in name,
# which is how a fifth nearly got written without anyone noticing the other four. The set is not
# stable by luck either: `index.dart` was added once, and nothing would have carried it to a copy.
#
# A CEILING OF ONE WITH A NAMED HOLDER, the shape test_port_ratchet.py uses. If this has to rise, the
# thing to write down is why that file cannot ask file_law, not a bigger number.

# BUILT IN TWO HALVES so this file is not its own first offender — the rule
