# b20260905 regression — one process asks the capability question once, and answers it the way
# nine processes did.
#
# The nine gates were nine `command` entries per harness, so every tool call spawned nine
# interpreters over one payload: 0.40 s on a Read that needs two of them. core/hooks/dispatch.py
# runs them in-process off core/hooks/gates.txt (0.054 s, 7.4x). Collapsing processes is only safe
# while the contract survives it, so what is checked here is the contract, never the speed: a
# blocking gate still exits 2 with its OWN words on stderr, a gate that dies takes only itself, and
# a gate the table calls `informs` cannot block.
#
# The case that earned this file is test_a_gate_guarded_by_dunder_main_actually_runs. The first
# working dispatcher exec'd each gate under the module name importlib gives it, so
# checks/heredoc-gate.py — the one gate ending `if __name__ == '__main__'` — imported cleanly, ran
# nothing, and the dispatcher exited 0. A silent pass wearing a success's coat, found by diffing a
# gate's own output against its output through here, which is what that test now does forever.
