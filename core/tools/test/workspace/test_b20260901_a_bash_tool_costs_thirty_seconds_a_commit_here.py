# b20260901-a-bash-tool-costs-thirty-seconds-a-commit-here regression.
#
# `sync-skills --check` cost 22.0 s on a Windows clone with the mirrors in sync, and
# core/hooks/commit/generators.py runs the tool TWICE, so every commit touching a skill paid ~30 s.
# The cause was fork, not work: ~300 forks at ~48 ms each under Git Bash -- a `basename` per skill
# per mirror, a `cmp` per copy, a `grep` per frontmatter field, and one whole Python interpreter per
# command file inside render_command. Nobody had measured it, and on Linux nobody would feel it.
#
# The fix was the port, and these hold the two things that could bring the cost back: a bash tool
# reappearing under core/tools/, and the check quietly becoming slow again.
