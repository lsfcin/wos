# T0 the feature registry's declaration half (core/SPECS.md § AD-14): every feature is declared,
# answered, and inside the closed sets its columns may draw from.
#
# The other half — whether a row that CLAIMS a switch really has one — is behaviour, not data, and
# lives in test_features_wiring.py. Splitting them was forced by the size gate and was right: this
# file reads three declaration files against each other and never runs a feature.
