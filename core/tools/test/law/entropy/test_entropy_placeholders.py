# T0 unanswered scaffold placeholders (first-line-comment rule, core/hooks/SPECS.md). Zero-token, runs in verify-fast.

# Split from test_entropy_list.py 2026-08-15, alongside the check itself. The branch
# these cover shipped with NO test, which is how it went a year labelled as the wrong
# defect: `← add` was reported as "prose describing finished work" and told the reader
# to cut it, when cutting it only makes the generator write it back on the next save.
# A check with no boundary test states a claim nobody ever read back.
