# b20260901 regression — a file the tree declares LF is LF, in the index AND on this disk.
#
# `.gitattributes` says `* text=auto eol=lf`, and its own head says LF is not "the Linux ending"
# here but the workspace's. Nothing checked it. test_encoding_ratchet.py comes closest and reads
# CALL SITES via AST — every open() naming `newline=` — which cannot see a file that is already
# wrong, so the rule had a policy, a rationale, and no instrument.
#
# WHY THE WORKING TREE IS HALF THE CHECK, and the half that is hard to want. Git normalises on
# read, so a CRLF working file whose blob is LF leaves `git status` CLEAN: the difference is
# invisible to every command an operator runs. That is exactly how core/skills/install.md came to
# be CRLF on the Windows clone and LF here — one skill spelled differently from the other sixteen,
# on one machine, found only because a port's equivalence diff compared bytes. Checking `i/` alone
# would pass on that machine and prove nothing.
#
# CONSEQUENCE, SAID OUT LOUD: this is green on this clone and will be RED on any clone whose
# working tree carries CRLF, until that tree is renormalised (`git add --renormalize .` and a fresh
# checkout). That is the check doing its job on the machine that has the defect, not a regression.
#
# WHAT IT FOUND on 2026-09-05: 18 tracked files, none of them the one the bug names. Fifteen were
# the unzipped members of a .docx under academy/administration/pda/template_extracted/ — `*.docx
# binary` covers the archive and says nothing about its contents once extracted — now declared
# `-text` and skipped here. Three were Google Forms CSV exports whose record separators were CRLF
# while their in-field newlines were already LF; those were renormalised, and their row and column
# counts are asserted below because a line-ending pass over a CSV is a data change if it is wrong.
