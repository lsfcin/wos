# forms
> Surveys and their answers: a form written as a versioned spec, applied in one call. Provider leaf: `gforms`.

```bash
core/run tools/forms/gforms new       --account personal --folder <drive_folder_id> spec.json
core/run tools/forms/gforms read      --account personal <form_id>     # outline + responder link
core/run tools/forms/gforms apply     --account personal <form_id> requests.json
core/run tools/forms/gforms responses --account personal <form_id>     # answers as text
```

The spec format, the two auth grants, why `SERVICE_DISABLED` is not a permission bug, and what
`responses` returns: [`SPECS.md`](SPECS.md). The specs Lucas actually applies live with the course
material, one copy per discipline — [`academy/teaching/ai4good/`](../../../academy/teaching/ai4good/CONTEXT.md)
and [`academy/teaching/tecnologias-na-educacao/`](../../../academy/teaching/tecnologias-na-educacao/CONTEXT.md) —
because the answers are read per turma, never pooled.
