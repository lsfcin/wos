## Tool Discipline (Read First)

Tool names are literal. Use only tools visible in the current tool set. See `core/tools/` for runtime-specific mappings.

- Search: use `web_search`
- Fetch URLs: use `fetch_content`
- Agent delegation: use `subagent` when available
- If a tool returns `Tool not found`, map to the canonical visible tool or record the capability as blocked.

Review this AI research artifact: $@

Derive a short name from the artifact name (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words). Use this short name for all
files
in this run.

This is an execution request, not a request to explain or implement the workflow instructions. Carry out the workflow
with tools and durable files.

Do not ask for confirmation. Briefly summarize the plan to the user and continue immediately unless the user explicitly
asked to review the plan first.

Required artifacts:
- Plan: `outputs/.plans/<name>-review-plan.md`
- Evidence notes: `outputs/.drafts/<name>-review-evidence.md`
- Final review: `outputs/<name>-review.md`
- Provenance: `outputs/<name>-review.provenance.md`

Workflow:
1. Create `outputs/.plans`, `outputs/.drafts`, and `outputs`.
2. Write `outputs/.plans/<name>-review-plan.md` with:
   - artifact identifier and source type (arXiv ID, URL, local file, PDF, Markdown, etc.)
   - review criteria: novelty, empirical rigor, baselines, reproducibility, claims validity, figures/tables, metrics,
     related work, writing quality
   - verification checks needed for claims, figures, reported metrics, data/code availability, and linked artifacts
3. Continue immediately. Do not end after planning.
4. Inspect the artifact:
   - For local files, read or parse the file directly.
   - For PDFs, use available PDF/document parsing tools. If parsing fails, use any available fallback extraction, record
     the failure, and still produce a blocked or partial review artifact.
   - For arXiv IDs or URLs, fetch the paper/source directly and record the URL.
   - Inspect linked code, datasets, supplemental material, or citations when they are reachable and materially affect
     the review.
5. Write evidence notes to `outputs/.drafts/<name>-review-evidence.md` before writing the final review. Include
   quoted/paraphrased claims, observed methods, reported metrics, baseline comparisons, reproducibility facts, and every
   inspected source path or URL.
6. Use the `researcher` and `reviewer` subagents only if the `subagent` tool is available and the artifact is large
   enough to benefit from delegation. If subagents are unavailable or would only add overhead, do the lead-owned review
   directly.
7. Write exactly one final review artifact to `outputs/<name>-review.md` with:
   - Summary Assessment
   - Strengths
   - Critical Issues
   - Major Issues
   - Minor Issues
   - Reproducibility and Verification
   - Inline Annotations tied to sections, claims, figures, or tables where possible
   - Recommendation
   - Sources
8. If the artifact cannot be parsed or critical evidence is unavailable, still write `outputs/<name>-review.md`. Mark
   the affected sections with `Verification: BLOCKED`, explain exactly what failed, and distinguish blocked checks from
   actual paper weaknesses.
9. Write `outputs/<name>-review.provenance.md` (date, artifact identifier, sources inspected vs accepted vs rejected,
   verification status). Before responding, verify on disk that both `outputs/<name>-review.md` and its provenance
   sidecar exist. If the review is missing, create it immediately as a blocked review artifact with the failure reason.

Never end with planning-only chat. Never ask what to do next. Never claim the review is complete unless
`outputs/<name>-review.md` exists.
