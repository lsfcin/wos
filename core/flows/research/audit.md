## Tool Discipline (Read First)

Tool names are literal. Use only tools visible in the current tool set. See `core/tools/` for runtime-specific mappings.

- Search: use `web_search`
- Fetch URLs: use `fetch_content`
- Agent delegation: use `subagent` when available
- If a tool returns `Tool not found`, map to the canonical visible tool or record the capability as blocked.

Audit the paper and codebase for: $@

Derive a short name from the audit target (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words). Use this short name for all
files
in this run.

## Required Artifacts

Every run must leave these on disk:
- `outputs/.plans/<name>.md`
- `outputs/<name>-audit.md`
- `outputs/<name>-audit.provenance.md`

Once evidence gathering starts, never end with chat-only output. If the repo or paper is unreachable, write a partial
audit plus provenance with `Verification: BLOCKED`.

Requirements:
- Before starting, outline the audit plan: which paper, which repo, which claims to check. Write the plan to
  `outputs/.plans/<name>.md`. Briefly summarize the plan to the user and continue immediately.
- Use the `researcher` subagent for evidence gathering and the `verifier` subagent to verify sources and add inline
  citations when the audit is non-trivial.
- Compare claimed methods, defaults, metrics, and data handling against the actual code.
- Call out missing code, mismatches, ambiguous defaults, and reproduction risks.
- Read the paper and the actual code before characterizing either; mark each claim verified, inferred, or blocked
  honestly; never invent results.
- Save exactly one audit artifact to `outputs/<name>-audit.md`.
- End with a `Sources` section containing paper and repository URLs, and write `outputs/<name>-audit.provenance.md`
  (date, paper + repo identifiers, claims checked, verification status). Verify both files exist on disk before
  responding.
