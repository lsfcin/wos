    `_is_exec_script` — "extensionless AND starts with a shebang" — a second copy of a
    question `file_law.is_code_file` already answers. S5 taught that module the shape rule
    (`is_tool_entrypoint`) when the port stripped the shebangs; this copy never heard, so
    all 33 core/tools CLIs silently lost their routing row, and the loss was invisible
    because the generator simply rewrote each table without them. Caught 2026-08-29 when

    (`academy/reviews/…/outputs/CONTEXT.md`) was a scaffold this generator wrote itself, inside a
    directory git is told to ignore — the row and the file it pointed at were both its own work.

    Asked of the paths about to become rows, never inside `is_scanned`: that question is shared
    with the commit-time description gate, and one `git check-ignore` per file would put a
    subprocess in the recursion `has_code_content` runs on every save.

    A generated mirror is carried by its generator instead of by git — `.opencode/skills/` and the
    three trees beside it are rebuilt from `core/skills/` on every sync, so a clone that installs
    has them and the rows are true. `is_generated_mirror` already knows which those are, and
