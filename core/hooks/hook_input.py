# A SESSION MARKER IS A DIRECTORY, ONE FILE PER ENTRY, and that shape IS the fix for a lost mark.
#
# These were one text file appended to per entry, and a PostToolUse hook is one process per Read, so
# a parallel batch of N reads ran N of them at once. Measured 2026-09-02 on this clone, 16 concurrent
# trackers over 30 rounds: `open(path, 'a')` lost an entry in EVERY round — 22% of writes gone — and
# `os.open(O_APPEND)` + a single `os.write` lost them in 8 rounds of 20. The CRT emulates append as
# seek-to-end-then-write, which is not atomic across processes, so the last writer overwrites what
# landed between its seek and its write. What the agent saw was a gate re-demanding a CONTEXT.md it
# had just read, on the turn it did the right thing.
#
# Creating a DISTINCT file is atomic on both systems: no lock, no retry, and nothing here has to ask
# the boundary what an operating system is. The entry's name is a digest of the path so the same mark
# twice is the same file, which is also what makes marking idempotent and lets every caller drop its
# read-before-write guard.
