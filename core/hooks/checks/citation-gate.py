# Level 0: a roadmap item number is not a citable identifier outside the roadmap family.
#
# Why this is a check and not a paragraph. Completion is deletion in this workspace, so the
# day an item closes, every `Front 4.1` pointing at it becomes a pointer to nothing — or
# worse, to whatever item later takes that number. § How to read this has asked for durable
# pointers since 2026-08-15 and the corpus still reached 91 numbered citations across ~50
# files, including two pointing at Fronts 2 and 6, which have never existed. The rule was
# INDUCED; this is the ENFORCED half.
#
# It lives here rather than in entropy/ because the crowding gate said so: entropy/ was already
# at eight code files and the ratchet refused a ninth. That was the right refusal — the check
# belongs beside type-gate.py, which is the other Level 0 vocabulary gate, and being here made
# it a commit-time BLOCK instead of one more line in a report nobody is obliged to read.
#
# Not a ratchet, unlike type-gate.py: the corpus was swept to zero on 2026-08-16, so every
# staged file is checked rather than only the ones a commit adds. A ratchet is what you use
# when you inherit violations, and there are none left to inherit.

# `Front 9`, `Front 4.1`, `Front 10.1b` — the bare form is the larger half of the corpus and
# the one a decimals-only pattern misses. Hyphen and word boundaries both count, so

# The pre-2026-08-16 spelling. This check owns the rename rather than
# core/SCHEMA.md § Retired tokens, because that table matches a bare word and
# `frente` is an
# ordinary Portuguese noun — it means a work front, and `branches/casinhas/CONTEXT.md` uses it
# that way in a table header about construction. A retired-token row would have failed on
# honest Portuguese prose on the day it was written, which SCHEMA.md's own note says trains
# people to ignore a check. Matching the *citation shape* instead keeps the word legal and the
# pointer illegal. Unlike CITATION this is a hit EVERYWHERE, roadmaps included: a rename is
# finished only when the old spelling appears nowhere.

# The list family may number its own items: that is what numbering is FOR, and a commit

# THE SECOND DEAD POINTER, the same defect wearing numbers. `core/hooks/limits.env` owns every
# numeric limit and `file_law.py` is its only parser, because a checker that restates the law is
# the drift the checkers exist to catch. Prose was never held to that: on 2026-09-12 eight authored
# files still named the line law one ruling behind, six days after it moved. Ruled by Lucas that
# day, scope this law only. THE FIX IS NEVER TO CORRECT THE COPY — delete it and name the owner,
# the way `code/CONTEXT.md` does. A corrected copy rots at the next ruling; a pointer cannot.
#
# NOT A VALUE COMPARISON, deliberately: asking whether a number still MATCHES goes quiet the day
# the law moves off a value a stale line happens to share, which is the day the check is needed.
# The shape is banned, exactly as `Front 4.1` is whether or not that item exists.
#
# `cap` is NOT a law word. limits.env says "a WARN asks for a look, a BLOCK stops the commit", and
# `cap` is the general word: it pulled in four numeric laws that are not this one, which is a
# roadmap finding rather than something to smuggle in here. `LOC` is the SUBJECT and never the law
# word — `56 LOC now` measures, `200 LOC | Hard block` copies.
