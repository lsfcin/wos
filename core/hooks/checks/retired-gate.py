# PostToolUse, capability `write` — a retired token reaches the agent at the edit, not at the close.
#
# THE CHECK ALREADY EXISTED AND WAS MERELY LATE. `entropy_list.retired_hits` is exact and costs
# zero tokens, and its only caller was the entropy dashboard — a report written into ISSUES.md
# after the fact, which means a rename could stay unfinished for a whole session and be found by
# the close. Same law, same function, one moment earlier.
#
# WHY NOT AN AUTO-REPLACE, asked by Lucas 2026-09-13 and answered no: a word-for-word rewrite is
# blind to the four contexts this workspace actually has — a filename (`citation-gate.py`), a
# quoted error, a code block, and § Retired tokens itself, which must WRITE the dead token to
# declare it dead. A silent rewrite is also an edit nobody reviewed. core/SCHEMA.md § Vocabulary
# already rules that a spelling which is also a real word needs a shape rather than a token, and
# a replacer has no sense of shape at all. So: inform, and let the writer choose.
#
# WHY POST AND NOT PRE: pre-write carries the pending content in the payload rather than on disk,
# and asking `retired_hits` about it would mean a second copy of the scanning loop. The law has
# one reader (core/hooks/CONTEXT.md), so the moment moved instead of the code.
