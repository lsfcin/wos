# feature could be turned off. Every gate that consults this module becomes measurable; every gate
# that does not is counted as a finding by `core/tools/wos/features --findings`.

# simply not be there — and an ImportError here would take down every gate in the workspace to save
# a row of statistics. Same rule core/run states for a clone that is missing pieces.

# core/`. `norms` is the sixth and the only one without code: rules obeyed rather than enforced,
# the INDUCED half of the line whose ENFORCED half is file_law / schema_law / feature_law.

# pressure" and "you call it" — which misled a careful reader of its own data into reporting the
# capability half of this workspace as dead weight. Eleven rows cross: six are automatic and enforce
# nothing (rtk-compaction, subtree-read-tracking, precompact-wipe, brain-attention, opencode-plugin,
# caveman), five are on-demand and do push (the entropy scan's three checks, declared-deps, diagram).

# saying which features are switched ON, so "an active feature" would be ambiguous at every site.

# reviewable, rather than in an environment variable that vanishes with the shell.
