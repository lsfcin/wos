# Level 0 for the two stores that record what we know and how sure we are: core/experiments/ and
# core/refs/REFS.md. Zero-token, deterministic.
#
# These are the two rules this workspace cites as proof it knows how to doubt — a runnable `Method`
# with dated `Results` and `Limitations` never omitted, and a level marker on every reference — and
# until 2026-08-18 neither was verified by anything. They held because a few careful sessions
# followed them, which is INDUCED wearing ENFORCED's costume (core/SPECS.md § AD-16 band 1).
#
# Both stores are small and closed, so the check is total rather than sampled: no allowlist, no
# ratchet inside this module. The ratchet is the CALLER's — type-gate.py asks only about files a
# commit adds, the dashboard asks about all of them.
