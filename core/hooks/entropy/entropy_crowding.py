# Directory crowding: how many files one directory asks a reader to hold at once.
#
# The rule is not new. A files-per-directory threshold has always existed, and
# `context_synchronizer.sync` has always warned when a directory crosses it — but it warned
# to stdout, during a sync nobody reads, so the tail grew unopposed. This module is that
# same law, surfaced where the other Level 0 checks are read. Both the threshold and the
# definition of "code file" are imported from limits.env / file_law.py, never restated:
# a second copy of a limit is the drift these checks exist to catch.
#
# Why it belongs next to the size signals: a large routing table is not a formatting
# problem, it is the directory telling you it holds more than one responsibility. Splitting
# it costs one routing hop, so this is a SIGNAL, never a cap — see core/SCHEMA.md
# § Routing depth and locality for when the hop is worth paying.
