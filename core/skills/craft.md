  Run the craft flow: develop a feature in file-relayed loops with model autorouting
  (clarify → plan → ground → architecture → TDD → code → user test → ship).

# /craft

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Protocol

0. **Route first (the craft tree).** `/craft` is a tree, not one pipeline. Read
   [`core/flows/craft/route.md`](../flows/craft/route.md) and classify the task into a folder — `padaria` · `feature` ·
   `research` · `architecture` (map + rationale: [`core/flows/craft/tree.md`](../flows/craft/tree.md)). Record
   `subtree:` in the Carry block / STATUS. Then run that folder's flow:
   - `feature` / `padaria` → the craft flow below (feature is contract-first: Step 0 permission panel → Loop 3.5
     Contract Layout → Loop 3 concept-symmetry review → TDD → ship).
   - `research` → the matching
     `core/flows/research/{sota,literature,explore,compare,recipe,replicate,review,summarize,watch,audit}.md` or
     `core/flows/mechanism-search.md`.
   - `architecture` → [`core/flows/craft/architect.md`](../flows/craft/architect.md) (emits an ADR; chain into `feature`
     if it needs building).

   The steps below are the **feature/padaria** folder. For research/architecture, hand off and stop.

1. **Resolve provider before Loop 0 (fastest identification):**
   ```bash
   opencode models 2>&1 | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort -u          # configured providers
   echo "active: ${OPENCODE_MODEL:-?}"                            # orchestrator's own model (provider prefix = chain provider)
   rtk grep -E '"model":\s*"[^/]+' ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json[c]? opencode.json[c]? 2>/dev/null   # fallback
   ```
   Select the active provider's level-map row from [`core/flows/craft/routing.md`](../flows/craft/routing.md) (or, if the
   runtime is Claude Code/Copilot CLI, the anthropic/copilot row). If you plan **downward delegation** (e.g.
   orchestrator on openrouter → all loops on nvidia free), pick the level-map row of the *delegate* provider and record
   `chain-deleg: deleg=<from>→<to>` in the Carry block. Fill the Carry `provider:` / `level-map:` / `chain-deleg:` fields
   at Loop 0 — a chain without them is undefined.

2. Read `core/flows/craft/craft.md` in full — it is the spine (Core Principle, Carry, Autorouting, Return Flags,
   Orchestration, Loops 0–6.5, Cost Gate, Field Practice). Then read `core/flows/craft/routing.md` **once** (level →
   concrete model, delegation) and only your runtime's section of `core/flows/craft/runtimes.md` (spawn recipe). Do not
   load `prior-art.md` to run a chain.
3. Execute it with the task: $ARGUMENTS. This session is the orchestrator. You hold only verdict lines and the chain's
   provider+map — never paste loop file contents here.
4. Spawn each loop as a subagent per the flow's Orchestration section — pinned agent types `craft-low` / `craft-medium`
   / `craft-high`; pass the per-loop model from the resolved level-map (or rely on the frontmatter default). The
   executor's self-report tag is `executor: craft-<level> model=<provider/model-id> level=<level> deleg=<none|from→to>` —
   that is your per-loop cost/routing audit (`grep executor <project>/.craft/<name>/*.md`).
5. Level `max` is never auto-spawned: pause and tell the user (max-level quota is scarce and, on nvidia, a hard ceiling
   —
   `routing.md` § Provider delegation rule 4 may surface the cost delta or stop the chain).
6. Hold only verdict lines in this session. Never paste loop file contents here.

## Why this is provider-aware (one-liner for the next reader)

Each configured provider has its own coding-capable model list (`opencode models` check); the level table in
`routing.md`
fills levels **from availability first, benchmarks second, cost third**. A chain stays inside one provider by default;
downward delegation (openrouter→anthropic→copilot→nvidia) is cost-saving and encouraged; upward cross-provider promotion
requires your explicit consent every time. nvidia's max is a hard ceiling — nvidia cannot silently pull Kimi or Opus.

## Prior art & lineage

This flow is a production realization of Reflexion (Shinn 2023, <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366> — verbal-reflection
memory → durable append-only loop files), **LATM** (Cai 2023, <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126> — two-level
tool-maker/tool-user cost-spreading → the Autorouting table), and **Voyager** (Wang 2023,
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291> — iterative environment-feedback prompting + skill library → the Loop 5 user-test and
Loop 6.5 Skill Extraction). Full citations and the explicit override-mapping vs. the Autorouting table live in
`core/flows/craft/prior-art.md`; the load-bearing overrides of the Autorouting table stay in `core/flows/craft/craft.md`
